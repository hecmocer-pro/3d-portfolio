The story of this repository goes as follows
===

One day I went into **Codrops** and saw a [new post](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2020/09/22/ui-interactions-animations-roundup-10/) in their series *UI Interactions & Animations Roundup*.

Just scrolling I happened to cross paths with this [amazing concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/14072513-physics-3D-landing-page-concept) hosted on **dribble**

At that time I had...
- MOTIVATION — At work I was spending more time managing people than coding
- EXPERIENCE — I had done a small ThreeJS experiment a few weeks ago
- FREETIME — I had some free time available due to #reasons

So I decided, what the hell... lets do what people do... lets build a roadmap!

- Design in Sketch — 1 day
- Craft in Blender — 1 day
- Program in ThreeJS — 1 day +

The roadmap suddenly became more like this

- Design in Sketch — Few hours
- Craft in Blender — 1 day
- *Adopt a second cat*
- Search for physics engines in ThreeJS — 1 day
- *Get my two cats to get along together*
- Go through a course on **Udemy** about WebGL and Unity — 2 days
- Program in ThreeJS — 4 days almost fulltime (8h/day)

I have to thank so many people along the way

- [Codrops](https://tympanus.net/codrops/)
- [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/)
- [The one that inspired this project](https://dribbble.com/phamduyminh)
- [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/)
- [AmmoJS](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/)
- [Enable3D](https://enable3d.io/)
- [The one that made Enable3D](https://github.com/yandeu)
- And many other I take for granted like [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Github](https://github.com/)

My original objective was

- One hand, I wanted to do something different than the original concept. You know, to give it my personal brand
- On the other hand, I wanted to stick to the concept as much as possible because it is amazingly eye-catching

I still cannot believe that I pulled this off. Probably the longest side-project I've managed to stabilise and publish. Thanks for reading


I really hope you like this and hopefully get inspired
